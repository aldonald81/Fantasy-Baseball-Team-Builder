# Fantasy Baseball Team Builder with Genetic Algorithms
In this study, we explored existing methods of genetic programming and modified them to best build fantasy lineups
for Major League Baseball. Specifically, we were interested
in maximizing a teamâ€™s point total given a budget. We utilize variations of genetic programming techniques to analyze teams and players given their fantasy preseason option
value and 2021 season statistics to build the optimal team by
smartly allocating a given budget.
